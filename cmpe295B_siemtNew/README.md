# SJSU Final Master project cmpe295B_siemtNew under the guidance of professor vuppalapati

##cmpe295B_siemtNew
Smart Industrial equipment maintenance tool   will   provide   an   executive   dashboard   of information  using  real-time  analytics  on  application  data  and  predictive  analytics  to anticipate unfortunate situations using active data. Connectivity between machines, data, and people enable intelligent insights so one can get the most out of their processes and assets.

## Usage
1. Helps industrial organizations do not get proper insights about failures caused during  daily  operations  because  of  the  dependency  on  historic  data,  lack  of  prior information about assets health. 
2. Prevents unacceptable  failure, maintenance inefficiencies

## Developing
Technlogy satck - Node.js, angular js, html5, css,javascript,jquery,mongodb
Data emitted by the sensor is directly pushed to cloud (mongolab).

##Dependency
TI sensor tag is required to be connected to our application in order to view real-time statistics.

Please note to display real time analytics and run the rules engine it is required to have the sensor connected to the application, else the real time charts wont be displayed. If the sensor is not connected user can still view the historical charts.

###Run the app
install all the node modules- get into the project directory and run sudo npm install
Switch on the TI sensor
